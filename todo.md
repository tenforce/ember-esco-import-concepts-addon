Frontend
===
The frontend will be actually part of the existing frontend in Ember in the ESCO project. It will be very simple because it only consists of a form where the user can select the TSV file to upload and a few buttons:

 * Import (upload the file to this service at /import/taxonomy)
 * Validate (call the validator backend to validate the graph)
 * Transfer (call the copy-graph backend to copy the validated graph to the application database)








Cleanup
===
- Dummy template
- wait util
